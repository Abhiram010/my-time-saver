#my-time-saver This is a small basic python program to save time by using this you can get the desired content/part of Gmail and youtube. I used if conditions and web browser modules because I reverse engineered means I coded this program before I entered the world of python by using web resources and mainly stack overflow. At last, I would like to conclude that it saves lots of time and concentrate on the required content and hide remaining unnecessary content. it's developed to save time! let develop this time-saver more and more Future plans: full control on mail like delete mails and report spams Note: Make sure you have a default browser
